You will start by loading the dataset for this task.

The load_data() function shown below loads the data into variables x_train and y_train
x_train is the population of a city
y_train is the profit of a restaurant in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a loss.
Both X_train and y_train are numpy arrays.

# load the dataset
x_train, y_train = load_data()

View the variables
Before starting on any task, it is useful to get more familiar with your dataset.

A good place to start is to just print out each variable and see what it contains.
The code below prints the variable x_train and the type of the variable.

# print x_train
print("Type of x_train:",type(x_train))
print("First five elements of x_train are:\n", x_train[:5]) 
Type of x_train: <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
First five elements of x_train are:
 [6.1101 5.5277 8.5186 7.0032 5.8598]
x_train is a numpy array that contains decimal values that are all greater than zero.

These values represent the city population times 10,000
For example, 6.1101 means that the population for that city is 61,101
Now, let's print y_train

# print y_train
print("Type of y_train:",type(y_train))
print("First five elements of y_train are:\n", y_train[:5])  
Type of y_train: <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
First five elements of y_train are:
 [17.592   9.1302 13.662  11.854   6.8233]
Similarly, y_train is a numpy array that has decimal values, some negative, some positive.

These represent your restaurant's average monthly profits in each city, in units of $10,000.
For example, 17.592 represents $175,920 in average monthly profits for that city.
-2.6807 represents -$26,807 in average monthly loss for that city.
Check the dimensions of your variables
Another useful way to get familiar with your data is to view its dimensions.

Please print the shape of x_train and y_train and see how many training examples you have in your dataset.

print ('The shape of x_train is:', x_train.shape)
print ('The shape of y_train is: ', y_train.shape)
print ('Number of training examples (m):', len(x_train))
The shape of x_train is: (97,)
The shape of y_train is:  (97,)
Number of training examples (m): 97
The city population array has 97 data points, and the monthly average profits also has 97 data points. These are NumPy 1D arrays.

Visualize your data
It is often useful to understand the data by visualizing it.

For this dataset, you can use a scatter plot to visualize the data, since it has only two properties to plot (profit and population).
Many other problems that you will encounter in real life have more than two properties (for example, population, average household income, monthly profits, monthly sales).When you have more than two properties, you can still use a scatter plot to see the relationship between each pair of properties.
# Create a scatter plot of the data. To change the markers to red "x",
# we used the 'marker' and 'c' parameters
plt.scatter(x_train, y_train, marker='x', c='r') 
​
# Set the title
plt.title("Profits vs. Population per city")
# Set the y-axis label
plt.ylabel('Profit in $10,000')
# Set the x-axis label
plt.xlabel('Population of City in 10,000s')
plt.show()

Your goal is to build a linear regression model to fit this data.

With this model, you can then input a new city's population, and have the model estimate your restaurant's potential monthly profits for that city.

4 - Refresher on linear regression
In this practice lab, you will fit the linear regression parameters (𝑤,𝑏)
 to your dataset.

The model function for linear regression, which is a function that maps from x (city population) to y (your restaurant's monthly profit for that city) is represented as
𝑓𝑤,𝑏(𝑥)=𝑤𝑥+𝑏
To train a linear regression model, you want to find the best (𝑤,𝑏)
 parameters that fit your dataset.

To compare how one choice of (𝑤,𝑏)
 is better or worse than another choice, you can evaluate it with a cost function 𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)
𝐽
 is a function of (𝑤,𝑏)
. That is, the value of the cost 𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)
 depends on the value of (𝑤,𝑏)
.
The choice of (𝑤,𝑏)
 that fits your data the best is the one that has the smallest cost 𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)
.

To find the values (𝑤,𝑏)
 that gets the smallest possible cost 𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)
, you can use a method called gradient descent.
With each step of gradient descent, your parameters (𝑤,𝑏)
 come closer to the optimal values that will achieve the lowest cost 𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)
.
The trained linear regression model can then take the input feature 𝑥
 (city population) and output a prediction 𝑓𝑤,𝑏(𝑥)
 (predicted monthly profit for a restaurant in that city).

5 - Compute Cost
Gradient descent involves repeated steps to adjust the value of your parameter (𝑤,𝑏)
 to gradually get a smaller and smaller cost 𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)
.

At each step of gradient descent, it will be helpful for you to monitor your progress by computing the cost 𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)
 as (𝑤,𝑏)
 gets updated.
In this section, you will implement a function to calculate 𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)
 so that you can check the progress of your gradient descent implementation.
Cost function
As you may recall from the lecture, for one variable, the cost function for linear regression 𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)
 is defined as

𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)=12𝑚∑𝑖=0𝑚−1(𝑓𝑤,𝑏(𝑥(𝑖))−𝑦(𝑖))2
You can think of 𝑓𝑤,𝑏(𝑥(𝑖))
 as the model's prediction of your restaurant's profit, as opposed to 𝑦(𝑖)
, which is the actual profit that is recorded in the data.
𝑚
 is the number of training examples in the dataset
Model prediction
For linear regression with one variable, the prediction of the model 𝑓𝑤,𝑏
 for an example 𝑥(𝑖)
 is representented as:
𝑓𝑤,𝑏(𝑥(𝑖))=𝑤𝑥(𝑖)+𝑏
This is the equation for a line, with an intercept 𝑏
 and a slope 𝑤
Implementation
Please complete the compute_cost() function below to compute the cost 𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)
.


Exercise 1
Complete the compute_cost below to:

Iterate over the training examples, and for each example, compute:

The prediction of the model for that example
𝑓𝑤𝑏(𝑥(𝑖))=𝑤𝑥(𝑖)+𝑏
The cost for that example
𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡(𝑖)=(𝑓𝑤𝑏−𝑦(𝑖))2
Return the total cost over all examples
𝐽(𝐰,𝑏)=12𝑚∑𝑖=0𝑚−1𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡(𝑖)
Here, 𝑚
 is the number of training examples and ∑
 is the summation operator
If you get stuck, you can check out the hints presented after the cell below to help you with the implementation.

6 - Gradient descent
In this section, you will implement the gradient for parameters 𝑤,𝑏
 for linear regression.

As described in the lecture videos, the gradient descent algorithm is:

repeat until convergence:{𝑏:=𝑏−𝛼∂𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)∂𝑏𝑤:=𝑤−𝛼∂𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)∂𝑤}(1)
where, parameters 𝑤,𝑏
 are both updated simultaniously and where
∂𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)∂𝑏=1𝑚∑𝑖=0𝑚−1(𝑓𝑤,𝑏(𝑥(𝑖))−𝑦(𝑖))(2)
∂𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)∂𝑤=1𝑚∑𝑖=0𝑚−1(𝑓𝑤,𝑏(𝑥(𝑖))−𝑦(𝑖))𝑥(𝑖)(3)
m is the number of training examples in the dataset
𝑓𝑤,𝑏(𝑥(𝑖))
 is the model's prediction, while 𝑦(𝑖)
, is the target value
You will implement a function called compute_gradient which calculates ∂𝐽(𝑤)∂𝑤
, ∂𝐽(𝑤)∂𝑏


Exercise 2

Iterate over the training examples, and for each example, compute:

The prediction of the model for that example
𝑓𝑤𝑏(𝑥(𝑖))=𝑤𝑥(𝑖)+𝑏
The gradient for the parameters 𝑤,𝑏
 from that example
∂𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)∂𝑏(𝑖)=(𝑓𝑤,𝑏(𝑥(𝑖))−𝑦(𝑖))

Return the total gradient update from all the examples

2.6 Learning parameters using batch gradient descent
You will now find the optimal parameters of a linear regression model by using batch gradient descent. Recall batch refers to running all the examples in one iteration.

You don't need to implement anything for this part. Simply run the cells below.

A good way to verify that gradient descent is working correctly is to look at the value of 𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)
 and check that it is decreasing with each step.

Assuming you have implemented the gradient and computed the cost correctly and you have an appropriate value for the learning rate alpha, 𝐽(𝑤,𝑏)
 should never increase and should converge to a steady value by the end of the algorithm.

def gradient_descent(x, y, w_in, b_in, cost_function, gradient_function, alpha, num_iters): 
    """

    num_iters gradient steps with learning rate alpha

      w_in, b_in : (scalar) Initial values of parameters of the model
      cost_function: function to compute cost

          running gradient descent

          running gradient descent

    # number of training examples

    # An array to store cost J and w's at each iteration — primarily for graphing later
    J_history = []
    w_history = []
    w = copy.deepcopy(w_in)  #avoid modifying global w within function
    b = b_in
    
    for i in range(num_iters):
​
        # Calculate the gradient and update the parameters
        dj_dw, dj_db = gradient_function(x, y, w, b )  
​
        # Update Parameters using w, b, alpha and gradient

Expected Output:

w, b found by gradient descent	1.16636235 -3.63029143940436
We will now use the final parameters from gradient descent to plot the linear fit.

Recall that we can get the prediction for a single example 𝑓(𝑥(𝑖))=𝑤𝑥(𝑖)+𝑏
.

To calculate the predictions on the entire dataset, we can loop through all the training examples and calculate the prediction for each example. This is shown in the code block below.

\
m = x_train.shape[0]
predicted = np.zeros(m)
​
for i in range(m):
    predicted[i] = w * x_train[i] + b
We will now plot the predicted values to see the linear fit.

# Plot the linear fit
plt.plot(x_train, predicted, c = "b")
​
# Create a scatter plot of the data. 
plt.scatter(x_train, y_train, marker='x', c='r') 
​
# Set the title
plt.title("Profits vs. Population per city")
# Set the y-axis label
plt.ylabel('Profit in $10,000')
# Set the x-axis label
plt.xlabel('Population of City in 10,000s')
Text(0.5, 0, 'Population of City in 10,000s')

Your final values of 𝑤,𝑏
 can also be used to make predictions on profits. Let's predict what the profit would be in areas of 35,000 and 70,000 people.

The model takes in population of a city in 10,000s as input.

Therefore, 35,000 people can be translated into an input to the model as np.array([3.5])

Similarly, 70,000 people can be translated into an input to the model as np.array([7.])

predict1 = 3.5 * w + b
print('For population = 35,000, we predict a profit of $%.2f' % (predict1*10000))
​
predict2 = 7.0 * w + b
print('For population = 70,000, we predict a profit of $%.2f' % (predict2*10000))
For population = 35,000, we predict a profit of $4519.77
For population = 70,000, we predict a profit of $45342.45
Expected Output:

For population = 35,000, we predict a profit of	$4519.77
For population = 70,000, we predict a profit of	$45342.45
